## Commands to Run Before Completion
```bash
# 1. Code quality check
./Scripts/lint.sh

# 2. Full test suite
swift test --enable-code-coverage

# 3. Build verification
swift build --configuration release

# 4. Performance validation (if applicable)
swift test --filter PerformanceTests

# 5. Generate coverage report
xcrun llvm-cov export .build/debug/MarkdownReaderPackageTests.xctest/Contents/MacOS/MarkdownReaderPackageTests --format="lcov" --instr-profile .build/debug/codecov/default.profdata > coverage.lcov
```

- Compliance validation must be automated and verifiable
- Regulatory requirements must be continuously monitored

### 4. **Incident Response Readiness**
- Automated incident response must be tested and validated
- Security team must be alerted within 5 minutes of critical events
- Recovery procedures must be documented and automated
